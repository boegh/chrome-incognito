I have recently started using Chrome for a couple of reasons. One thing which I couldn't get my head around, was how to add an new Incognito Window button. I found an extension that did this (obviously I was not the only one missing this functionality), but that had 'Read your browsing history' as a required permissions. So I went for making my own (which in fact also has this permission requirement, but since you can easily check the source here yourself, the risk of abuse is (in this case) mitigated), and this is the result. Reuse at your own risk.

If you want to add it to your own Chrome, download the four files to a directory on your computer, enable 'developer mode' under Chrome extensions, and add them as unpacked extension.
